      <p>Instructions</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cut the duck in half, lengthways. Dry the halves thoroughly with
          kitchen paper. Heat the oil in a wok or a large frying pan until it is
          almost smoking, and deep-fry the two halves of the duck, skin side
          down. Turn the heat to medium and continue to fry slowly until the
          skin is browned. This should take about 15-20 minutes. Do not turn the
          pieces over, but baste the duck as it fries. Drain the lightly browned
          duck on kitchen paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine all the braising sauce ingredients in a large pan and bring to
          the boil. Add the duck halves and turn the heat down to a simmer.
          Cover the pan and slowly braise the duck for 1 hour, or until it is
          tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now make the garlic and vinegar dipping sauce. Combine the garlic and
          vinegar in a small dish and allow to sit for at least ten minutes
          before using.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the duck is cooked, skim off the large amount of surface fat that
          will have accumulated. This procedure will prevent the duck from
          becoming greasy. Now remove the duck halves from the sauce with a
          slotted spoon. Let them cool, then chop them into smaller pieces.
          Arrange on a warm platter, garnish with the fresh coriander and serve
          at once, with the Garlic and Vinegar Sauce. Alternatively, you can let
          the duck cool thoroughly and serve it at room temperature. Once the
          braising sauce has cooled, remove any lingering surface fat. It can
          now be frozen and re-used to braise duck or chicken. This dish reheats
          beautifully.
