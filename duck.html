      <p>Instructions</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Whisk together soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of the honey, and 1 teaspoon of
          the Chinese five spice in a small bowl until combined; set aside. Stir
          together salt and baking soda in a small bowl; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels; place a wire rack on top
          of paper towels, and set baking sheet aside. Pat duck dry with fresh
          paper towels, and remove and discard any excess fat around neck or
          cavity. Using your fingers, gently and carefully separate skin from
          meat, being careful not to tear any holes in skin. Brush duck evenly
          with soy sauce mixture, and sprinkle evenly with salt mixture,
          sprinkling some under skin. Place duck on prepared baking sheet.
          Refrigerate at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir together hoisin sauce and remaining 1 tablespoon honey and 2
          tablespoons Chinese five spice in a small bowl. Spoon hoisin mixture
          into duck cavity, and rub mixture into cavity using your hands. Insert
          a 6-inch wooden skewer into skin surrounding cavity near tail.
          Continue threading skewer through skin near cavity, alternating
          between left and right sides of cavity, to seal cavity. Place duck in
          a large heatproof bowl, and carefully pour 4 cups of the boiling water
          over breasts, legs, and wings of duck. Flip duck in bowl, and pour
          remaining 4 cups boiling water over back of duck. Pat duck dry with
          paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Return duck to wire rack
          on baking sheet. Refrigerate at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 350°F. Place duck in a large roasting pan fitted with
          a wire rack. Roast in preheated oven until skin is mostly crisp and
          deep golden brown, about 1 hour. Without removing duck from oven,
          reduce oven temperature to 250°F, and continue roasting until fat no
          longer renders from duck and skin is very crispy and dark golden
          brown, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven. Let rest at room
          temperature at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Carve. Serve duck
          alongside cucumber matchsticks, carrot matchsticks, thinly sliced
          scallions, Boiled Water Pancakes, and additional hoisin sauce.
