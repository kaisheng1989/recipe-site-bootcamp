      <p>Instructions</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place pork pieces between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable
          freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound pork
          with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2 inch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer pork pieces to a plate and season both sides generously with
          salt and black pepper; sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of flour, lightly
          coating both sides. Pour eggs over pork, turning to coat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place panko in a shallow bowl; place pork pieces in panko, pressing
          firmly to coat on both sides. Transfer breaded cutlets to a clean
          plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in pickles,
          jalapeño pepper, and green onions; cook and stir until onions have
          softened, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle in 1 1/2 tablespoons flour; cook
          and stir for 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slowly stir in 2 to 3 tablespoons cold milk, whisking constantly. Stir
          in remaining milk, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper. Simmer on
          low for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning; set sauce aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 1/4 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
          Add 1/2 of the breaded pork cutlets and cook until pork is no longer
          pink inside, and the crust is well-browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer to plate lined with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. Repeat
          with remaining vegetable oil and pork cutlets.
        </li>
        <li>Serve cutlets topped with sauce.</li>
